# 🎧 Offline Video & Audio Transcription Tool using OpenAI Whisper

Convert your offline video tutorials and audio lectures into clean, accurate transcripts — securely, privately, and without uploading anything online.

This project uses **OpenAI Whisper** to transcribe `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, and `.mp3` files directly on your PC.  
Unlike online transcribers, your data never leaves your system, making it **100% private and safe**.

## 🚀 Why I Built This Project
I had a huge library of offline video tutorials and wanted an efficient way to:
- Convert videos into text transcripts.
- Feed transcripts into AI tools.
- Generate detailed summaries, notes, and mind maps.

This saved me a massive amount of time and energy.  
Instead of manually watching hours of videos, pausing in between, and taking notes, the process is now fully automated.
